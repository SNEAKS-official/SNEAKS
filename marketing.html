                <h2> Execution & progress </h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Over the past weeks we have been creating and publishing lots of content for our social media channels. At the moment of writing this, we gained a total of 64 followers on Instagram, and 3 followers on TikTok. Especially on TikTok, our amount of followers is really low. We are not sure why this is exactly, as we DO have enough views on our content, and we also have interaction.</p>
                    <p>The highest amount of views on our TikTok content was 945 individuals, at the moment of writing this. Most of our videos on TikTok were watched between 250 to 1000 times, but engagement was minimal. We tried to add questions to the videos, to make the content 'interactive', in the hope users would comment, etc. But for a reason we cannot figure out, this didn't happen</p>
                    <p>We also tried to create different type of content, that would still have the similar overall vibe. We experimented with trending audio and video topics, we tried making use of other famous names and brands to leverage their platforms, and even though these things seemed to work (250-1000 views per video), there wasn't a great spike in any of the content we put out.</p>
                    <p>We also used lots of different strategies to try to get users to follow our brand. Think about crossplatform linking, replying to comments on other pages, asking questions to try and start a conversation, use hashtags in our posts, keeping a clear and consistent brand look overall, etc. These things definitely helped in building awareness, as new followers regularly started coming in. But this was way easier to achieve on Instagram then on TikTok. The overal experience I got from doing this campaign is that even though it is EASIER to reach more people on TikTok, it is HARDER to build a strong brand and gain followers in a short amount of time.</p>

                        <p>At the time of writing this, SNEAKS has a total of Instagram 64 followers. One strategy we used to attract followers is by following accounts that are similar to our own, and commenting with their content, and interacting/replying to other users. We also linked to our TikTok, made use of hashtags, added our posts to our stories, etc.</p>
                        <p>Over all, we reached 124 accounts at the time of writing this, with most account reached through our posts. 93 of these 124 are non-followers, which means users did visit our page, but did not follow our page. However, from the 124 that did view our page, about 1/3rd did follow us, which is higher than expected.</p>

                        <p>Even though our total viewers was much much higher than on Instagram, the amount of followers gained were almost none. This surprised us enoursmously, and even though we tried to create different types of videos, followers didn't come.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps it has to do with a misunderstanding of the platform, even though we clearly researched popular videos, and try to recreate them in a similar but unique style. In the future, we could create content which asks the users to follow our brand, and see if this has any effect.</p>

                <h2>Learning points</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>It’s relatively easy to gain views on TikTok due to it’s high organic reach. Our posts ranged in views between 200 to 1000 views. Even though we received way more visitors to our posts than on Instagram, we did not gain many actual followers on the platform. We are a bit confused by why this is exactly. It seems that brand loyalty is much higher and easier to achieve on other platforms such as Instagram.</p>
                    <p>Our Instagram follower growth has been growing steadily. Its important to keep interacting with others, as we found that this works best for getting people to follow our brand. When interacting with others, these users will take a quick look at our brand, and if they like the content they see, there is a high chance that these users will follow our account.</p>
                    <p>Creating original content is NOT easy. Since I did this campaign all by myself, I spend a lot of time creating posts, the website, the campaign, etc. It’s best to have a team of people to run a campaign, not only because more people can do more work, but also because more heads mean more ideas.</p>
                    <p>The use of hashtags didn’t seem to be really effective on both TikTok or Instagram. Also, adding locations to posts didn’t seem to attract many users, other than local pages asking to promote the post on their profiles, such as a page about “Amsterdam”.</p>

                <h2>Future planning</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>So far 9 posts for Instagram have been created, and 6 videos for TikTok. A total of 18 users have visited our website’s landing page. this is more than twice the goal we’d set at the start of this campaign! We’ve tried to make the content as consistent as possible across both social media channels. In case this project would continue, it would be recommended to keep creating content that is similar to the already existing content, especially keeping the fonts, colors, and other important brand visuals.</p>
                    <p>However, in the future, it might be better to also experiment with other sorts of content, especially on TikTok, as we saw that even though we received a reasonable amount of viewers, we had barely any users that converted into following us, nor any that visited our website’s landing page. Experimenting with different trends could be a way to see what content does well, and which content performs less well. If we see that a specific type of content does well, more content similar to this same topic should be made, to leverage the trend.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, we could have experimented with more different type of content, trying more trends, and seeing which one reaches most people. However, we already create quite some different styles of content, so we would just have to keep this going.</p>
