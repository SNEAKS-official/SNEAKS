          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>Design elements & justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #7DAFE0;"></span>
                  #7DAFE0
                  <em>We used this vibrant blue color, also described as ‘sky blue’ as the primary color for our brand. The reason why is because this color blue stands out from other colors, because of it’s brightness. BUT, at the same time, it is also soft enough not to be considered an intens color. Also, it matches well with styles/outfits that are worn often in the streetwear scene, so it subliminally links back to the industry.</em>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #F6F3E8;"></span>
                  #F6F3E8
                  <em>Beige - This color is used as a complimentary color for the primary blue color. The light beige color matches super well with the sky blue color, creating a beautifully soft color palette, while still making the brand look professional. Also, beige colors are very often used as a primary/secondary tone in streetwear. Again, linking back to the industry!</em>
                <li>
                    <p></p>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EBECED;"></span>
                  #EBECED
                  <em>Soft grey - Not used very often, but this soft grey color is used when the light blue or beige colors don’t fit in a specific situation. We chose this color because it doesn’t attract attention, and is just as soft as the blue and beige colors.</em>
                    <p></p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We chose 'Poppins' as the font to represent our brand. The reason being is that Poppins is a very clean, modern and minimal typeface. The style is nicely rounded, easy to read, doesn't scream for attention. This is exactly what we want to represent with our brand: Ease, softness, balance.</li>
              <p></p>
            <li>On our website, we made use of grids, carousels, and a menu bar. We used all these options to make the website as user-friendly and intuitive as possible. 
            <p></p>
            We use grids to show some of our Instagram and TikTok posts. We use a carousel to display our brand, brand colors, and mood board. And we chose to use a menu bar because there are quite some pages on this website, so a menu bar keeps the site look minimalistic.</li>
              <p></p>
            <li>Content has been divided evenly across all pages. Pages are divided into Marketing, Corporate, Brand Roadmap, and Investing sections. The navigation has been tried to make it as simple as possible, giving the user a menu bar with options to choose from. Some pages also link to each other, such as the landing page and the investment page. 
            <p></p>
            There is also a content hierarchy, with headings, bold text, etc. to keep a streamlined and good looking webstructure. 
            <p></p>
            Also, we tried to keep the site consistent by using the colors from the color scheme, and using the same hierarchy all across the website.
            <p></p>
            The website is also responsive for mobile devices, so that it can be accessed from whatever device the user prefers.


            As mentioned before, our goal was to keep the site look&feel as consistent as possible, by only using colors from the color pallette, using the same fonts, etc. 

          The landing page also links to the ‘invest’ page, as part of our funnel from our marketing strategy. </li>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Communications objectives
          <p></p>
          Our main objective for the communication on our social pages during this campaign was to spark our target groups interest by creating videos and photo posts that make them want to know more about the brand and what it represents. We want to try to get an emotional expression out of our target group, to achieve awareness to our social channels, to grow followers, and to create leads which will visit our website's landing page.
          <p></p>
          Besides that we wanted to focus on growing a follower base of people who are interested in the brand, so that in the future it becomes easier to reach a bigger group and lead more people to the website.</p>
          <p>We also have 4 reach objectives for this campaign:</p>
              <p>1. Reach 100 followers on Instagram within the first 3 weeks of our campaign</p>
              <p>2. Reach 50 followers on TikTok within the first 3 weeks of our campaign.</p>
              <p>3. Have 10% of our IG and TikTok followers like and interact with our posts at the end of the 3 week campaign. (This would be 15 people for post out of 150 total)</p>
              <p>4. Have 5% of our IG and TikTok followers redirected to check out our website/landing page in 3 weeks. (This would be a total of 8 people out of 150 total).</p>
            <p>The goal of this campaign is to have leads convert to our landing page. We want to get them to do so by focusing on the individual users’ emotions and decision making process.</p>
            <p>For this campaign we focused on Men between 18 and 29-years-old who are interested in sneaker culture, located in Western-Europe.</p>
            <p>We chose to use Instagram and TikTok as our social media channels, because research shows that these platforms are among the most popular for our target group.</p>
            <p>Please find the full marketing plan <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edbBXyt4rvFjF8WxaqQkiJwMfzLTFYrL/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>These are the biggest learning points:

          <p><li>It’s relatively easy to gain views on TikTok due to it’s high organic reach. Our posts ranged in views between 200 to 1000 views. Even though we received way more visitors to our posts than on Instagram, we did not gain many actual followers on the platform. We are a bit confused by why this is exactly. It seems that brand loyalty is much higher and easier to achieve on other platforms such as Instagram.</li></p>
          <p><li>Our Instagram follower growth has been growing steadily. Its important to keep interacting with others, as we found that this works best for getting people to follow our brand. When interacting with others, these users will take a quick look at our brand, and if they like the content they see, there is a high chance that these users will follow our account.</li></p>
          <p><li>Creating original content is NOT easy. Since I did this campaign all by myself, I spend a lot of time creating posts, the website, the campaign, etc. It’s best to have a team of people to run a campaign, not only because more people can do more work, but also because more heads mean more ideas.</li></p>
          <p><li>The use of hashtags didn’t seem to be really effective on both TikTok or Instagram. Also, adding locations to posts didn’t seem to attract many users, other than local pages asking to promote the post on their profiles, such as a page about “Amsterdam”.</li></p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>So far 9 posts for Instagram have been created, and 6 videos for TikTok. A total of 18 users have visited our website’s landing page. this is more than twice the goal we’d set at the start of this campaign! We’ve tried to make the content as consistent as possible across both social media channels. In case this project would continue, it would be recommended to keep creating content that is similar to the already existing content, especially keeping the fonts, colors, and other important brand visuals.</p>
          <p>However, in the future, it might be better to also experiment with other sorts of content, especially on TikTok, as we saw that even though we received a reasonable amount of viewers, we had barely any users that converted into following us, nor any that visited our website’s landing page. Experimenting with different trends could be a way to see what content does well, and which content performs less well. If we see that a specific type of content does well, more content similar to this same topic should be made, to leverage the trend.</p>
          <p>Looking back, we could have experimented with more different type of content, trying more trends, and seeing which one reaches most people. However, we already create quite some different styles of content, so we would just have to keep this going. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>This whole site, together with all content created for our Instagram and TikTok pages, were designed around our brand’s visual identity. We hope this is recognized by the end user as a consistent whole of high quality. A brands identity is very important because it is the first thing a user sees when interacting with our brand.</p>
